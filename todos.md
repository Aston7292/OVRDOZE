# list of tasks or improvements to be made.

here is a way to organize future features, and coordinate work on the game.
or for new people who want to help: here are things that still need to get done.

1. impliment a way back to the menu screen from the game. (esc currently just closes the whole program)
2. resolution: ability to change window size in game.
3. correct resolution detection of monitor.
4. in-game settings menu (volume / quit to menu / resolution)
