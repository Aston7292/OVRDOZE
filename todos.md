## List of tasks or improvements to be made.

here is a way to organize future features, and coordinate work on the game.
or for new people who want to help: here are things that still need to get done.

# Important
1. Begin unit testing.
2. Begin automatic testing pipeline in github.

# Road to 1.0

## Content
1. 3-5 more levels.
2. Finish soldier class, a harder gun wielding enemy present in some levels.
3. A boss in last level.
4. Explosive weapons and couple more energy weapons.
5. More stuff to do in overworld. Stock market, upgrades for you and the robot, bigger inventory purchases.
6. More dialogue (more NPCs).
7. More equipment (a temporary radar consumable, which reveals a Halo-like radar in HUD).
8. Separate "career" mode from endless mode, start a career mode by starting game in Overworld.
9. Ability to save progress in career mode.
10. Add a thank you page for collaborators.
11. A zombie that chucks explosive fleshbombs.

## Known bugs
1. Quitting to main menu and starting overworld again doesn't reset the map.
2. HUD displacement in higher resolutions.
3. Knockback is not affected by fps timedelta.
4. On higher resolutions zombies grind the game to a halt. Figure out what causes this (not the rendering!)
5. Investigate why zombies get stuck in Requiem in lower right corner.
